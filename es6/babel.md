Babel is a JavaScript "transpiler", it compiles "source to source" (JavaScript to JavaScript).

Different transforms allow us to use features/technology/syntax that wouldn't usually be possible. e.g. ES2015, React, jsx.


## Presets
Presets are essentially plugins for Babel that transpile specific features or languages.

Today we'll be using:
- ES2015
- Stage 0 (Very early feature proposal)
- Stage 1 (Proposal, it will goto a draft spec)
- Stage 2 (Draft spec)
- Stage 3 (Candidate, spec complete and browser implementations)
- React

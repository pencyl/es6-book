Babel is a JavaScript "transpiler", it compiles "source to source" (JavaScript to JavaScript).

Different transforms allow us to use features/technology/syntax that wouldn't usually be possible. e.g. ES2015, React, jsx.


## Example

Input:
```javascript
var myString = `hey`;
```

Output:
```javascript
var myString = "hey";
```

> You can try Babel out and see the transpiled code live on the [Babel site](https://babeljs.io/repl)


## Presets
Presets are essentially plugins for Babel that transpile specific features or languages

Today we'll be using:
- ES2015
- Stage 0
- Stage 1
- Stage 2
- Stage 3
- React

# Browser support

ES6 consists of a large number of features, browser support can vary. It's best to check on a feature by feature basis.

Depending on your user base or the feature required it's still recommended to either [transpile](/es6/babel.md) or [polyfill](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim).

See the [ECMAScript 6 compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) for more detail as to which features are currently supported.

# Browser support

100% of ES6 is supported from:
- Chrome 49
- Safari 10
- Firefox 36
- Opera 38
- Edge 13

IE11 is still lacking as are a lot of mobile browsers. Depending on your user base it's still recommended to either [transpile](/es6/babel.md) or [polyfill](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim)

See the [ECMAScript 6 compatibility tables](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) for more detail as to which features are currently supported.

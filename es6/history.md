# ECMAScript standards
A lot like the W3C, JavaScript has a standards body. Strictly "ECMAScript" is a specification/langauge that other languages track, ActionScript, JavaScript & JScript

## ES4
An overview of ES4 was released in October 2007, it would've been the largest change to the spec since the ninties. It failed and was abandoned for various technical & political reasons.

ES3.1 came along, promising to be a smaller and safer way to evolve the language and that became known as ES5...

## ES5
You've probably used it without realising it. ES5 brought strict mode, Object.freeze(), getters & setters, support for the "JSON" library (stringify/parse).

## ES6

Around 2012 work started on what we call ES6, originally named ES.Harmony, then ECMAScript 6th Edition.

In 2015 the committee responsible decided to move to define standards on an annual basis. New features are now only added to a spec once approved rather than massive drafts that would take longer to finalize. As a result ES6 is officially known as ES2015.

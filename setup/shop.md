# es6-shop

Today we'll be working on a basic shop example.

It's a basic React app, running on Express, using Webpack and Babel to handle our ES6.

Don't worry if you've not used React before, we'll cover a small example before diving in.

Products are loaded via AJAX on the left. When clicking "Add to cart", they're added to the cart on the right and the total is calculated.

We've got a discount field, which will do another AJAX request to get a random amount of discount from our server.
